## Python Simple Cycles
Algorithm for finding all the simple cycles in a directed graph.

Implemented from "_Finding All the Elementary Circuits of a Directed Graph_" by Donald B. Johnson.

Note that I did not write `tarjan.py`. I obtained that [here](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01208083168).
